# LONG AGO

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Ow, my spirit!

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

## Another Heading

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. But I've never been to the moon! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

# Slurms McKenzie

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
