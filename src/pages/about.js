      <p>
        Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a
        celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Tell her she looks thin. I am the
        man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! As an interesting side note, as a head
        without a body, I envy the dead. I just told you! You've killed me! Say
        what? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Of all the
        friends I've had… you're the first. I'm sure those windmills will keep
        them cool. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Say what? OK, this has gotta
        stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
        All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit…
        that's why I'm transferring to business school!
